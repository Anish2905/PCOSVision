# PCOS Detection Tool

PCOS Detection Tool is a deep learning-based application designed to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) from medical images. The project comprises a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, a Flask backend for serving predictions via API, and a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for user interaction.

## Overview

This repository contains all the code and assets required for the PCOS Detection Tool, which includes:
- **Model Training:** A CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
- **Backend:** A Flask application that loads the trained model and provides an API for predictions.
- **Frontend:** A user-friendly HTML interface for uploading images and displaying prediction results.
- **Evaluation:** Scripts to plot training history, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and Precision-Recall curves.

## Features

- **CNN Model:** Custom CNN architecture with layers including convolution, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Image loading, resizing, normalization, and one-hot encoding of labels.
- **Model Evaluation:** Generation of classification reports, confusion matrices, ROC, and Precision-Recall curves.
- **Flask API:** Lightweight backend to handle image upload and prediction.
- **Responsive Frontend:** HTML/JS interface with dark mode support and visual feedback (e.g., image preview, loading spinner).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/pcos-detection-tool.git
   cd pcos-detection-tool
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Example requirements.txt:

nginx
Copy
Edit
tensorflow
keras
opencv-python
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
Pillow
scikit-learn
flask
Prepare your dataset:

Place your image dataset in a directory (e.g., dataset_extracted/PCOS).
Organize the images in subdirectories corresponding to their class labels (e.g., "Infected" and "Not Infected").
Usage
Training the Model
Run the model script to load data, train the CNN, evaluate its performance, and save the model.

bash
Copy
Edit
python your_model_script.py
The training script will:

Load and preprocess images from the dataset.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train the CNN model using early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks.
Generate plots for accuracy, loss, ROC, and Precision-Recall curves.
Save the best model as best_model.h5 and the final model as final_model.h5.
Running the Flask App
Once the model is trained, you can start the Flask application to serve predictions:

bash
Copy
Edit
python your_flask_app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the PCOS Detection Tool. Upload an image through the web interface to see prediction results.

Model Training and Evaluation
Data Loading & Preprocessing: Images are read using OpenCV, converted from BGR to RGB, resized to (128, 128), and normalized.
Model Architecture: The CNN consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dropout and dense layers.
Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using classification reports, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and Precision-Recall curves.
Visualization: Training history (accuracy and loss) is plotted to monitor the performance during training.
Flask API
The Flask backend performs the following:

Loads the trained model (final_model.h5).
Provides an endpoint /predict that accepts an image file via POST request.
Processes the image (resizing, normalizing) and returns a prediction result (either "Infected" or "Not Infected") in JSON format.
Frontend
The HTML frontend includes:

File Upload: A drag-and-drop upload box with image preview functionality.
Prediction Button: A button to send the image to the Flask API.
Result Display: Visual feedback with styled messages based on the prediction outcome.
Dark Mode Toggle: A simple toggle for switching between light and dark themes.
